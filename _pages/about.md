Hello, I am an aspiring coder learning how to use programming languages to make games.

I'm earning my Bachelor in Computer Science at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). Researching different forms of recursion to help improve my coding. I am willing to learn new things to enhance my knowledge and be able to create new things that seem difficult to do.

# Education

C++ is my primary language studied with some knowledge on Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My main focus is game development and learning methods to better improve my creations. In addition, improving my recursion methods and dynamic programming to improve the time complexity of my code. 

To learn more about what I have or can learn visit the Computer Science page for University of Houston at [cs.uh.edu](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/).
