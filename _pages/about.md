Hello, I am an aspiring coder learning how to use programming languages to make games.

I'm earning my Bachelor in Computer Science at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/). Researching different forms of recursion to help improve my coding. I am willing to learn new things to enhance my knowledge and be able to create new things that seem difficult to do.
