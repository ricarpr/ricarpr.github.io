I am working on getting my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Houston.

C++ is my primary language studied with some knowledge on Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My main focus is game development and learning methods to better improve my creations. In addition, improving my recursion methods and dynamic programming to improve the time complexity of my code.
